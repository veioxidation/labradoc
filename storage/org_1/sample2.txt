This is a sample text document used for testing document processing.

It contains multiple lines of text to demonstrate basic document structure.

Some key information:
- Document Type: Report
- Issue Date: 2024-01-18 
- Reference Number: REF-2024-007

The document processing system should be able to extract and classify this information

Additional paragraphs can be included to test content extraction capabilities.
This helps validate that the document processing pipeline works as expected.
